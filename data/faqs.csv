"What is Azure Cognitive Search?","Azure Cognitive Search is a cloud search service that gives developers infrastructure, APIs, and tools for building a rich search experience over private, heterogeneous content in web, mobile, and enterprise applications. It provides full-text search capabilities, semantic search, and AI-powered features like entity recognition and key phrase extraction.","azure,cognitive-search,search,ai"
"How do I create an Azure OpenAI resource?","To create an Azure OpenAI resource: 1) Go to the Azure portal, 2) Search for 'Azure OpenAI' and select it, 3) Click 'Create', 4) Fill in the required details (subscription, resource group, region, name), 5) Choose your pricing tier, 6) Review and create. After creation, you'll need to request access to specific models through the Azure OpenAI Studio.","azure,openai,setup,deployment"
"What is the difference between Azure OpenAI and OpenAI?","Azure OpenAI Service provides REST API access to OpenAI's powerful language models including GPT-4, GPT-35-Turbo, and Embeddings model series. The key differences are: Azure OpenAI runs on Microsoft's Azure infrastructure, offers enterprise-grade security and compliance, provides regional data residency, and integrates with other Azure services. OpenAI's API runs on OpenAI's infrastructure.","azure,openai,comparison,enterprise"
"How do I authenticate with Azure Cognitive Search?","Azure Cognitive Search supports two authentication methods: 1) API Key authentication - use admin or query keys in the request header, 2) Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication - use service principals or managed identities. For most applications, API key authentication is simpler. Admin keys provide full access, while query keys are read-only.","azure,cognitive-search,authentication,security"
"What is semantic search in Azure Cognitive Search?","Semantic search in Azure Cognitive Search enhances search relevance by understanding the context and intent of queries. It uses language understanding to find the most semantically relevant results, even when exact keyword matches aren't present. Features include semantic ranking, semantic captions, and semantic answers. It requires a semantic configuration and works with specific query types.","azure,cognitive-search,semantic-search,ai"
"How do I deploy a Streamlit app to Azure?","To deploy a Streamlit app to Azure: 1) Create an Azure App Service, 2) Configure it for Python, 3) Set up deployment from GitHub or Azure DevOps, 4) Add a requirements.txt file to your project, 5) Configure environment variables, 6) Deploy your code. You can also use Azure Container Instances or Azure Kubernetes Service for containerized deployments.","azure,streamlit,deployment,app-service"
"What are the pricing tiers for Azure OpenAI?","Azure OpenAI offers several pricing tiers: Pay-as-you-go (no upfront commitment), Provisioned Throughput Units (PTUs) for predictable costs, and Reserved Capacity for long-term commitments. Pricing varies by model (GPT-4, GPT-35-Turbo, etc.) and region. You can estimate costs using the Azure pricing calculator.","azure,openai,pricing,costs"
"How do I handle errors in Azure Cognitive Search?","Azure Cognitive Search returns HTTP status codes and error messages. Common errors include: 400 (Bad Request) for invalid queries, 401 (Unauthorized) for authentication issues, 404 (Not Found) for missing resources, and 429 (Too Many Requests) for rate limiting. Implement proper error handling and retry logic in your applications.","azure,cognitive-search,error-handling,api"
"What is the difference between GPT-4 and GPT-35-Turbo?","GPT-4 is more capable than GPT-35-Turbo in reasoning, creativity, and handling complex tasks. GPT-4 can handle longer conversations and more nuanced instructions. GPT-35-Turbo is faster and more cost-effective for simpler tasks. Choose based on your use case requirements and budget constraints.","openai,gpt-4,gpt-35-turbo,comparison"
"How do I optimize Azure Cognitive Search performance?","To optimize Azure Cognitive Search performance: 1) Use appropriate service tiers, 2) Optimize index design and field mapping, 3) Use faceted navigation and filters, 4) Implement caching strategies, 5) Use scoring profiles for relevance tuning, 6) Monitor performance metrics, 7) Consider using search suggestions and autocomplete.","azure,cognitive-search,performance,optimization"
